# Library-database-with-User-Interface.
Used open sourced postgreSQL DBMS along with JDBC software to give a perfect user interface as a localhost. PHP can be used to host it on a globalhost network.
Use netbeans to open the 'library' file.
In the code change 'url' to the location of your localhost. Change user and pass to whatever is your postgreSQL username and password.
Now you can successfully connect to the database (files in FinalLibrarySchema folder).
This library allows you to read a book, issue a book, add it to your wishlist, read journals, blogs etc.
Every book can be rated and reviewed by any user. And average rating for each book can be viewed.
Just as an example, I added values by connecting CSV files, which contains "dummy data". You can change the values or add your own CSV files by changing the directory in the code.
